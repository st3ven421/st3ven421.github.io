## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2, part 2
  
  It was one of my favorite labs because it combined problem solving with creativity. I loved how we could implement complex concepts, like calculating date differences and Julian days, in a hands-on way, and also taught me how to debug the function

* Lab 9, part 1
  
  I also choose this lab as my favorite because I enjoyed using file I/O to read words and comparing them to a dictionary. Identifying misspelled words was satisfying, and it strengthened my skills in vectors and search algorithms. 

* Lab 10 part 1
  
  Last lab that was my favorite was because it involved working with real-world data county populations. I enjoyed processing the data using vectors and strings, and the challenge of extracting and summing population information was rewarding. It also helped me strengthen my skills in managing and manipulating data structures.
